                            Resource Availability: One of the biggest challenges in healthcare is finding the right resources at the right time. 
                            Our platform provides up-to-date information on hospital bed availability, blood supplies,

                            Improving Healthcare Efficiency: By making it easier for patients to find the care they need, 
                            our platform helps reduce overcrowding in hospitals and ensures that medical resources are used more efficiently. 
                            This not only helps individual patients but also improves the overall healthcare system.</p>
